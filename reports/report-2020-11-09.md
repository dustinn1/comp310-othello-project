# Weekly Progress Report 4 - 11/09/2020

## Improvement Report

For this week, I've made two noticeable improvements to the game. The first one was an update to the UI. I was able to implement the library ncurses. With this library, the game now appears as its own separate things. Compared to before where the game was printing at the bottom-left of the terminal window, the game now appears top-middle of the window. In addition, ncurses allows for the window to update with only the relevant information appearing on the screen. Every time there is a new turn, the board, for example, updates with the new pieces. This is much better compared to how it was previously where all of the turns would stack on top of one another.

Another thing that I did this week was getting started on completing milestone 3. For this milestone, we have to convert the game from player-vs-player, to player-vs-computer. The first thing that I did was I made one of the players into a computer player. Afterwards, I made it so that once the player plays their turn, it will switch to the computer where it would then add a piece to the board automatically. In order to do so, the computer chooses a random coordinate out of a list of coordinate that will result in a playable move. Making it choose a random coordinate is a temporary solution at the moment until I am able to get a search tree created. But overall, it works and is therefore a somewhat acceptable solution. But it is also not very good at picking winning moves. 

## Goals List

- Continue to improve the UI with ncurses
	- Make the board appear bigger
	- Add more colors
	- Fix the centering and width of certain text lines
- Start implementation of a search tree for the computer player to increase the difficulty of the computer player.
- Improve some tests
