# Weekly Progress Report 3 - 11/01/2020

## Improvement Report

For this week, I've been working on fixing bugs and making improvements because I am able to move on to milestone 3. For the last weekly report, I noticed that there were some problems with the board ADT and the game. The biggest problem was that incorrect spots on the board were coming up as correct. Thus, you were able to place a piece with no pieces next to it; this would break the game. I've been able to fix the function handling this. There were also some smaller bugs that didn't affect the game too much that I've fixed.

There are also some additions I've made to improve the game. One of those additions was adding more indicators to show which player currently has a turn. A simple header now at the top of each turn's board showing either "Black's turn" or "White's turn." I've also made it so the squares on the board showing valid spots to place a piece at will either be filled in white or black. Something else I added was coordinate input validation. The x and y of a coordinate has to be between or equal to 0 and 7. It also has to be a valid position (as indicated by the squares). Lastly, the game will show who has won the game by the number of pieces each player has.

## Goals List

- I noticed that there are still some cases where an incorrect spot on the board is showing up as a correct spot. These were often unique and rare cases so they are a bit harder to solve but I still would like to fix them.
- I want to continue to improve the UI of the game.
	- I feel like the text currently being shown like number of pieces and so forth can be position better. Right now, it all feels too close to one another.
	- I also want to look into ncurses that was in the assignment's pdf but it make take a while before I am able to use this library.
- Lastly, I want to get started on milestone 3. This will take a while since I will need to develop a search tree, etc.
