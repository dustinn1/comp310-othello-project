## Improvement Report

This week, I've been working on improving the computer player for my Othello game. In order to do so, I started developing a search tree for my game. With a search tree, it allows for the computer player to predict future moves and allows for it to decide which position it can place its piece that would result in the best outcome. So in the case of Othello, what would happen is that the computer player would look 3 or 4 moves ahead. It would see how many pieces gets flipped by the computer and the player each turn.

Essentially, I am basing this idea off of the minimax algorithm. So each node in the tree would contain the number of pieces flipped based on where ever a piece gets added. In the end, for each route to the bottom of the tree, it would calculate a number. It would add the number of pieces flipped by the computer and subtracted the number flipped by the player. So in the end, the position that gives the highest number will get selected by the computer to place its piece on for that turn. 

While I got an idea of what I want to do for this search tree, I still have a lot left to do in order to complete. So far, I have only been able to get a start with developing the tree's abstract data type.

## Goals List

-  Add more onto the ADT 
	- like having each node hold the number of pieces flipped.
	- Fix the board not copying correctly for the nodes on the tree.
	- and so forth.
- Fix pieces not getting added on the boards of the tree nodes.
- Get the computer to decide which position it should choose when the search tree is created.
