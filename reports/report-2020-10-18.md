# Weekly Progress Report 1 - 10/18/2020

## Improvement Report

Being that it was the first week, there wasn't any improvement since there were only additions. Therefore, I'm going to report on what I've done to start on this project. For this week, I've been working on completing milestone 1 which was to create an abstract data type for my Othello board. For the most part, I've been successful in doing so. However, there are some things that I still need to implement that I listed below in Goals List.

For my board ADT to work, I had to implement another ADT for the pieces. So in total, there was `board_t` and `piece_t`. A board can hold many pieces, for instance. Afterwards, I implemented many of the functions that uses the`board_t` structure to `board.c`. The functions that I added were: `board_init()` which initializes the board; `board_add_pieces()` which add pieces to the board; `board_print()` which prints the contents of the board; `board_copy()` which copies the contents of a board to another board. There were also some functions used to check the board's conditions such as if the board was full and so on. 

The last thing that I added to the progress as of week 1 was just a demo c file to test the ADT implementation. Running `board-test.c`, you can see the the structures and functions I've added are working as intended. In addition, I've added some unit testing to test what I have currently and any future additions.

## Goals List

There is still some stuff that need to be added in order to complete milestone 1. They are the following:
- Cleanup and condense the code for `board_can_place()` (and all code in general).
- Add a way to check if a piece can be place diagonally.
- Have a way to determine whether pieces can be flipped horizontally, vertically, and/or diagonally.
- Implement a way to flip a piece
- Be able to keep track the number of pieces of each color on the board.

Once I've finished milestone 1, I plan on working towards completing milestone 2.
