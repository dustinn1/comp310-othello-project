# Weekly Progress Report 2 - 10/26/2020

## Improvement Report

This week, there has been significant improvements done for the game. For one, I was able to complete the ADT for the Othello board and make it functional to use. I added diagonal moves; more specifically, in addition to horizontal and vertical, it can now check if pieces diagonally can be flipped. With the ability to check if a piece can flip other pieces in all 8 directions, I added visuals on the board on where a piece can be placed. Most importantly, I implemented the ability for pieces to be flipped. So, the correct number of pieces should flip horizontally, vertically, and/or diagonally. Beside those major ones, I did some other minor improvements and additions. They were displaying the number of pieces each player has, use letters of represent pieces, and just general improvement of functions like the `board_can_add()`.

Afterwards, I got to work on completing milestone 2. Overall, I was able to get a functional game that was text-based and player-vs-player. The implementation is pretty barebone at the moment. A board gets initialized and player black starts the game. Like described above, it displayed valid piece placement spots on the board. A player can add a piece by entering coordinates. It then switches to player white to play their turn. This continues to alternate until the Othello board is completely filled with pieces. 

## Goals List

Even. though I completed milestone 1, I. noticed while working on milestone 2 that there were some bugs and problems with the ADT.
- The function that checks if a piece can be placed diagonally needs to be updated. There were some instances where it showed a diagonal move could be played yet was incorrect.
- The `board_delete()` function doesn't work at the moment. This is needed to free the board and pieces from memory when done.
- In addition, more things on the board (like pieces) needs to be free'd when done.
- Improvement of the code such as having just one 'define' for the piece's char to allow for easy changes.

As for milestone 2, there are still things that are missing yet necessary.
- Add a way to handle errors.
	- If a player enter a coordinate that puts a piece at an invalid spot, it doesn't tell the player to re-enter the coordinate and just switches to the next player.
- When the board is filled up, it needs to choose who wins the game by picking who has the most pieces.
- Improvement of the UI
- Add comments the code
